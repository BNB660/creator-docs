Example Prefabs allow world creators to use the Creator Economy quickly and easily without writing their own Udon scripts. The prefabs can be tweaked and customized to create a better experience for your supporters.

Please visit our [example repository on GitHub](https://github.com/vrchat-community/examples-creator-economy) to access the examples.
- To download all examples, click the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP". Extract the ZIP file and open it with the VRChat Creator Companion.
- To learn how to use the examples, please read the [README file](https://github.com/vrchat-community/examples-creator-economy#readme).

:::note
Many of the examples require knowledge on how to set up Udon products, which should be done before you proceed here. Head to our [Getting Started with the Creator Economy SDK page](/economy/sdk/getting-started/) to learn more.

## Adding Prefabs

Each prefab shares the same starting steps:

1. Download the Unity package for the prefab you need, which can be found in the left sidebar.

2. Import the package into your Unity project.
